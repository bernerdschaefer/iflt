		Release history
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Version 1.11
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Kevin Hammond's (substantial) additions to provide a Haskell version
of all the code. 

He's also thrown in CodeGen.hs, a stanalone MIPS code generator that
integrates with the intermediate form (used as part of a course
exercise)

Add rule for Unwind of an NConstr to the G-machine Mark 6.

Put math-code stuff back in to fpsty.sty
(new version found thanks to Will Partin).

Version 1.10 (25 Aug 1997)
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Minor fixes to language.src (due to Justin Cormack)
Mention that you need old Latex (2.09) not new (2e) in installation guide
Comment out the math-code section in fptstyle.sty because it doesn't
	work here at Glasgow any more.  I'm looking for another
	way to get the same effect.  For now, some tyepset text
	will look less good.

Version 1.9 (16 Nov 1995)
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Patch to installation.src (due to Nathan Loofbourrow).  Without the
patch, the explanation of how versions work in the .src files is
automatically stripped of the version information, which ruins the
explanation.

Modifies Chapter 4 (the TIM chapter) and corresponding tutor's guide
to include Gofer code.  Due to Allyn Dimock.

Version 1.8 (8 June 1995)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Modifies Chapters 1, 2, 3, 6 and Appendix A to include the
Gofer code produced by Allyn Dimock 

I havn't tested this Goferised verison either!  If you don't need it,
you'll be safer with 1.6.

Version 1.7 (22 June 1994)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Modifies gm.src only to include the Gofer code produced by Marko Schuetz.

I havn't tested this Goferised verison!  If you don't need it, you'll
be safer with 1.6.

Version 1.6 (22 June 1994)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Captures the current state of affairs just before integrating some
newly Gofer-ised source in 1.7.

A new file "Contributions.src" is added, with some thoughts about
the book contributed by various people.  So for they are not integrated
with the main book in any way at all.

Quite a few typos fixed compared with 1.6 --- see ERRATA.  Nothing serious.

Version 1.5 (16 Sept 1992)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Fixed embarassing bug in version-processing which prevented anything
Latexing at all.

Version 1.4 (15 Sept 1992)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some small bug-fixes to 1.3
	* Typos in the ERRATA file (!).
	* A bug-fix which prevented the book Latex-ing.

make-version script now understands the "ALL" flag, to tell it
	to select all versions for a given language

The main Makefile now has a variable, $(LANGUAGE), which controls what
language (currently Miranda or Gofer) is selected when you typeset the
book.  The default is "M" (for Miranda).

Version 1.3 (Aug 20 1992)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Stephen Eldridge's revised language.src and language-tutor.src
	added.  This release isn't guaranteed to be all working,
	though it probably does; its main reason for existing 
	is so that he has the same snapshot as me.

More tiny portability changes to the Makefile

A number of smallish errors throughout,
	described in the (new) file ERRATA

Lots of trivial typography stuff which makes the diffs look large!

Version 1.2 (Jan 15 1992)	-- THIS VERSION CORRESPONDS TO THE PUBLISHED BOOK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Add subtitle to book ("Implementing functional languages: a tutorial").
Small bug-fixes to the text of the G-machine chapter.
Minor fixes to Makefile, fpstyle.sty and installation instructions.

Version 1.1 (Dec 11 1991)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lots of typographical errors fixed.  
Index split into Subject and Code indices.
No changes to the code.

Version 1.0 (Oct 31 1991)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The original release.
